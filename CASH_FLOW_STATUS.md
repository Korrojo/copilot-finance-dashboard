## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Data Range Limitation
**Issue:** Financial data only covers Jan-Sept 2025
**Impact:**
- "This Month" (October) shows $0.00 if selected
- October appears in charts with zero values
- Limited historical data for comparisons

**Workaround:** Default changed to "Last 3 Months" (has data)

**Future Fix:** Add October 2025 data to `financial_data.json`

---

### 2. Mock Income Data
**Issue:** Income is calculated as 130% of spending, not from real transactions

**Current Logic:**
```typescript
income = Math.abs(spending) * 1.3
```

**Impact:**
- Income/spending ratio is artificial
- Actual income sources are simulated
- Savings rate may not reflect reality

**Future Fix:** Use actual income transactions from data

---

### 3. Limited Chart Data Points
**Issue:** Only 3 months of data displayed (Aug, Sep, Oct)

**Impact:**
- Trend lines are short
- Historical comparison limited
- Patterns hard to identify

**Why:** Default "Last 3 Months" range only captures Aug-Sep with actual data + Oct empty

**Future Fix:**
- Change default to "Last 12 Months" for better trends
- Or ensure October data exists

---

### 4. Granularity Simulation
**Issue:** Daily/Weekly views split monthly totals evenly, not from real transactions

**Current Logic:**
```typescript
daily: monthTotal / 30
weekly: monthTotal / 4
```

**Impact:**
- Daily/weekly charts show artificial smooth distribution
- Can't see actual daily transaction patterns
- Spikes and valleys are lost

**Future Fix:** Aggregate from transaction-level data with actual dates

---

### 5. Category Distribution
**Issue:** Stacked chart distributes categories proportionally across months

**Current Logic:**
```typescript
categoryAmount = (monthTotal * categoryPercentage)
```

**Impact:**
- Category proportions same every month
- Can't see how category spending changes month-to-month
- No seasonal patterns visible

**Future Fix:** Use actual category spending per month from transactions

---

## Visual Quality Assessment

### Summary Cards: 8/10
**Strengths:**
- Clean layout with good spacing
- Sparklines provide quick trend view
- Color coding is intuitive (green=good, red=spending)
- Stats provide useful context

**Improvements Needed:**
- Sparklines could be slightly larger
- Consider adding min/max indicators

---

### Combo Chart: 7/10
**Strengths:**
- Successfully combines bars + line
- Tooltip shows all three values
- Color coding clear

**Improvements Needed:**
- Bars could be wider for better visibility
- Line could be thicker or more prominent
- Consider bar opacity to make line more visible
- Only 3 data points makes trend unclear

---

### Stacked Chart: 7/10
**Strengths:**
- Category breakdown is clear
- Colors are distinct
- Tooltip shows detailed breakdown with totals
- Click-to-filter works well

**Improvements Needed:**
- Only 3 columns makes visualization cramped
- Category labels could be more visible
- Consider showing category names on bars
- Limited data points reduce usefulness

---

### Forecast Chart: 6/10
**Strengths:**
- Clearly distinguishes actual vs projected
- Dashed line for projections is good UX
- 30/60/90 day summary is useful

**Improvements Needed:**
- Only 3 actual data points limits forecast accuracy
- Projection algorithm is very simple (random variance)
- Could benefit from trend analysis
- Missing confidence intervals

---

## Comparison to Reference Designs

### vs Copilot Money
**Matches:**
- ✅ Summary cards with sparklines
- ✅ Large value displays
- ✅ Percentage changes
- ✅ Clean visual hierarchy

**Missing:**
- ⚠️ More granular time periods (we have limited data)
- ⚠️ Richer tooltips with context
- ⚠️ Smoother animations

**Score:** 7.5/10

---

### vs Monarch Money
**Matches:**
- ✅ Combo chart (bars + line)
- ✅ Stacked category breakdown
- ✅ Interactive filtering
- ✅ Time granularity controls

**Missing:**
- ⚠️ More data points for better trends
- ⚠️ Advanced chart interactions
- ⚠️ Category trends over time

**Score:** 7/10

## Recommended Improvements (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Add October 2025 Data**
   - Populate `financial_data.json` with Oct 2025 transactions
   - Ensures "This Month" works properly
   - Gives 4th data point for better charts

2. **Use Actual Transaction Data for Charts**
   - Build monthly aggregations from real transactions
   - Show actual category spending per month
   - Enable real daily/weekly granularity

3. **Improve Default Date Range**
   - Change to "Last 12 Months" or "Year to Date"
   - Show more historical context
   - Better trend visualization

---

### Medium Priority
4. **Enhance Chart Visuals**
   - Increase bar width in combo chart
   - Thicken net income line for visibility
   - Add subtle animations on hover
   - Improve grid and axis styling

5. **Better Forecast Algorithm**
   - Use linear regression or moving average
   - Add confidence intervals
   - Show multiple scenarios (conservative/optimistic)
   - Factor in seasonal trends

6. **Richer Tooltips**
   - Add context (% of total, vs average)
   - Show daily/weekly breakdown
   - Include year-over-year comparisons

---

### Low Priority
7. **Additional Chart Types**
   - Area charts for cumulative view
   - Waterfall chart for period changes
   - Sankey diagram for money flow

8. **Export & Sharing**
   - PDF export of charts
   - Share link generation
   - Screenshot/image export

9. **Advanced Filters**
   - Filter by account

- Charts render quickly
- Interactions are responsive

### Suggested Optimizations
- Code split chart components
- Lazy load recharts library
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Virtual scrolling for long lists

---

## Testing Coverage

- [x] All date ranges work
- [x] All comparison types work
- [x] Granularity toggles work
- [x] Category filtering works
- [x] Charts render correctly
- [x] Tooltips display properly
- [x] Responsive on different screen sizes

### Automated Testing: ❌ Not Implemented
- [ ] Unit tests for hooks
- [ ] Component tests for charts
- [ ] Integration tests for interactions
- [ ] E2E tests for user flows

## Overall Assessment

### Current State: **7/10** - Good, but needs polish

**Strengths:**
- Core functionality works well
- Data displays correctly
- Interactive features functional
- Matches reference designs reasonably well

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited data points reduce effectiveness
- Some artificial data (mock income, simulated granularity)
- Charts could be more visually polished
- Missing October data is confusing

---

## Honest Answer to "Are You Satisfied?"

**No, not completely satisfied yet.**

**Why:**
1. **Data limitations** - Only 2-3 real data points makes charts look sparse
2. **Visual polish** - Charts work but aren't as refined as Copilot/Monarch
3. **Mock data issues** - Income and granularity are simulated, not real
4. **October gap** - Missing month creates confusion

**What would make it satisfactory:**
1. Add October 2025 data
2. Extend to 12 months of historical data
3. Polish chart spacing and colors
4. Use real transaction aggregations
5. Improve forecast algorithm

**Current recommendation:** Functional for demo/MVP, but needs data and polish before production-ready.
