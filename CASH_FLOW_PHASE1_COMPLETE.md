## Technical Details

### Date Calculation Logic

**This Month:**
- Start: First day of current month
- End: Today

**Last Month:**
- Start: First day of previous month
- End: Last day of previous month

**Last 3 Months:**
- Start: First day of 3 months ago
- End: Today

**Last 12 Months:**
- Start: First day of 12 months ago
- End: Today

**Year to Date:**
- Start: January 1 of current year
- End: Today

### Comparison Calculation

**Previous Period:**
- Duration = current_end - current_start
- Comp_start = current_start - duration - 1 day
- Comp_end = current_start - 1 day

**Same Period Last Year:**
- Comp_start = current_start minus 1 year
- Comp_end = current_end minus 1 year

### Percentage Change Formula

```
change = ((current - comparison) / |comparison|) × 100
```

Special handling:
- Spending increase = bad (red)
- Spending decrease = good (green)
- Income increase = good (green)
- Income decrease = bad (red)

## User Experience Flow

1. **User opens Cash Flow page**
   - Defaults to "This Month"
   - Compares to "Previous Period"
   - Shows current month data

2. **User changes date range to "Last 12 Months"**
   - Date range updates
   - Comparison auto-updates to previous 12 months
   - All metrics recalculate
   - Charts update with 12 months of data
   - Percentage changes show year-over-year trends

3. **User changes comparison to "Same Period Last Year"**
   - Comparison recalculates
   - Percentage changes now show vs last year
   - Label updates: "vs same period last year"

4. **User selects "No Comparison"**
   - Percentage change indicators hide
   - Just shows absolute values
   - Cleaner view for analysis
