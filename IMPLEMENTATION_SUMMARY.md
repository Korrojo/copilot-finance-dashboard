# Implementation Summary: Fixed Missing Features

This document summarizes the features that were implemented to fix the non-working functionality identified in the Transactions page.

## Date: October 23, 2025

## Issues Identified

Based on the screenshot at `docs/images/local/Transactions/Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 1.18.48 AM.png`, the following features were not working:

1. ❌ Split transactions functionality
2. ❌ Bulk categorize button (showing "feature coming soon" alert)
3. ❌ Bulk mark reviewed button (showing "feature coming soon" alert)
4. ❌ Merchant logos/icons (only blue dots showing)
5. ❌ Split button in side panel (showing alert)
6. ❌ Recurring button in side panel (showing alert)

## Implementations Completed

### 1. ✅ Merchant Logos/Icons in Transaction List

**Changes:**
- Imported `MerchantIcon` component

- Falls back to initials with consistent color hashing when logo not available

**Visual Impact:**
- Each transaction now shows a distinctive merchant icon
- Major merchants (Amazon, Starbucks, etc.) display with branded colors
- Unknown merchants show initials in colored circles (e.g., "DD" for Dunkin' Donuts)

**Location in Code:** `src/pages/Transactions.tsx:564-569`

3. Enter split amounts and categories
4. Use "Equal Split" for automatic distribution
5. Click "Save" to create split transactions

### 5. ✅ Recurring Transaction Functionality in Detail Panel

**File Modified:** `src/pages/Transactions.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Updates transaction with `isRecurring: true` flag
- Connected handler to `TransactionDetailPanel` props
- Integrates with undo/redo stack

**Features:**

- Updates transaction object with `isRecurring` flag
- Can be used by recurring detection algorithm to identify patterns
- Undo available via Cmd+Z

**User Flow:**
1. Open transaction detail panel
2. Click "Recurring" button (enabled when 2+ similar transactions exist)
3. Transaction marked as recurring
4. Transaction updated with recurring flag
5. Can be used for subscription tracking and reminders

**Location in Code:** `src/pages/Transactions.tsx:349-354`

## Technical Details

### Integration Points

All implementations integrate with existing systems:

1. **Undo/Redo Stack:** All mutations use `performAction()` with descriptive messages
2. **Transaction State:** Uses `useUndoStack` hook for state management
3. **Toast Notifications:** Undo actions show in toast notifications
4. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript type safety maintained
5. **Design System:** All new components follow existing dark theme patterns

### Type Additions

The following TypeScript properties are now utilized (were added in Phase 3 but not implemented):

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  // ... existing fields
  isSplit?: boolean;              // Used by split functionality
  parentTransactionId?: string;   // Used by split functionality
  isRecurring?: boolean;          // Used by recurring functionality
  splitTransactions?: TransactionSplit[];  // Used by split functionality
}
```

### State Management

All features use the centralized `useUndoStack` hook:
- Single source of truth for transaction data
- Automatic history tracking
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Z, Cmd+Shift+Z) work automatically
- Action descriptions shown in undo button tooltips
