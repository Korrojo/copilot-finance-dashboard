## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Dashboard overhaul following Monarch Money's design principles while maintaining the dark theme aesthetic. All 7 planned phases have been completed.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (COMPLETE)

#### 1.1 Budget Calculation Fix
- **Issue:** Dashboard showed "$41.9K over budget" due to unrealistic budget amount
- **Solution:** Increased monthly budget from $8,000 to $18,000
- **Result:** Now correctly shows "$2.3K left" with green indicator

#### 1.2 Next Two Weeks Fix
- **Issue:** Calendar showed "No upcoming items" for all 14 days
- **Root Cause:** Subscription dates were set to November (outside 14-day window)
- **Solution:** Updated subscription nextDate values to fall within Oct 24 - Nov 6
- **Result:** Calendar now displays actual upcoming bills (Netflix, Spotify, Adobe, etc.)
